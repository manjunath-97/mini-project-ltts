# Requirements
## Introduction
Searching for  a book in a real large library is very tedious process and keeping manual method of tracking book transactions is even more tedious. So through this program I have come up with a solution which can ease these tasks by implementing a “C program” using the linked lists Data Structures. This program is able to keep track of the book transaction in the library. We begin with adding  books of different genre to the corresponding genre.
In  this program we user can perform adding, borrowing  and returning of the books and more importantly displaying the information of the books in the library. 

## Research
![Description](Link to Pic)
Traditional libraries maintained hardcopies or registers to hold  the information of books in the library. They also had to maintain the register to maintain the details of issueing and return of books from the readers.
Using the current technology a online library management system can be implemented which reduces manual works in significant amount and makes the system work faster.

## Defining Our System
The Library management system provides two types of logins, one for the admin who looks after the tasks of bringing new books to the library, issueing books to the borrowers, the other type login for borrowers which maintains the information of the books they have borrowed. The users can easily see all the books available in the library.
## SWOT ANALYSIS

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

**User**Librarians who maintains the info of the books and looks after the tasks of issueing and returning. Borrowers who want to issue books from the library.

## What:

**Product**A library management system to digitalize the libarary transations such as issueing books and returning. The system also gives the info of the books and genres the library has.

## When:

**Active**The traditional record based system require much man-power and to repace the traditional system the developed project can be used. It reduces the work and cost involved and makes the book transaction faster and seamless.

## Where:

**TBD** The developed application can be used in the college, school libraries etd.,

## How:

**Inputs**The application provides two interface, one for the admin(Librarian) and the other for the users. The admin has the features fron the application to add different genres and books to those genres. On the other hand users use display feature of the application to find books and issue and return after the use.
